# FHIR-Starter

## Introduction 

The goal of the **FHIR-Starter** is to ease the deployment of an Azure Healthcare API FHIR Service along with a Service Client to get users up and running with FHIR in minutes rather than days.  

Azure API for FHIr is generally availability for both public and government in multiple [geo-regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=azure-api-for-fhir&regions=non-regional%2Cus-east%2Cus-east-2%2Cus-central%2Cus-north-central%2Cus-south-central%2Cus-west-central%2Cus-west%2Cus-west-2%2Ccanada-east%2Ccanada-central%2Cusgov-non-regional%2Cus-dod-central%2Cus-dod-east%2Cusgov-arizona%2Cusgov-texas%2Cusgov-virginia). For information about government cloud services at Microsoft, check out Azure services by [FedRAMP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/compliance/azure-services-in-fedramp-auditscope).
